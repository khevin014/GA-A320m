# Vanilla OSX on AMD Athlon 200GE

This EFI folder uses Opencore 0.5.6 bootloader

  - You need to change the SMBIOS as it may have been used already
  - Might work for other 17h CPUs

# Whats Working
  - onboard LAN
  - onboard Audio (except front panel microphone)
  - iServices(Facetime should work if you have a webcam)
  - Sleep/Wake up
  - Siri

# My Actual PC Specs
  - AMD Athlon 200GE Processor overclocked to 4.0GHz

You can update up to 10.15.4 using this EFI folder.
If you have any issues, feel free to contact me at u/khevinski014.
Please note that I only have Athlon 200GE as of the moment, if you're having issues with your build other than the specs stated above, please use Google (it's free).
You also need to change the SMBIOS for iServices to work as the one provided here might already be in use. GIYF!
